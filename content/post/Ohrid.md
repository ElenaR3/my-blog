I am not sure how many times have I visited it, but I know that every time is a good idea.
Amazing city with amazing views that leave me amazed every time like it is the first. You may get annoyed 
by the many tourists around you,
but still be able to connect with the magic of the city.

<b>Here are my personal 5 favorite things in Ohrid: </b>

1. <b>Monastery of St. Naum</b> - A short drive from Ohrid, atop a small cliff above the shore of the lake is the Monastery of Sveti Naum (St. Naum).
 Established in the 10th century, St. Naum is buried here. It is said you can hear his heartbeat in the church if you press your ear up to his tomb. Visitors should be aware of the peacocks on the ground. Yes, they do attack. If youâ€™re looking for a little romance, take a boat ride on the freshwater springs of the River Drim at the base of the monastery.

2. <b>Samuil's Fortress</b> - Atop the ridge of a small peninsula jutting into Lake Ohrid is the fortress of Samuil. This hilltop has served host a fortification since the 3rd century BC. The current fortress built for Tsar Samuil dates from the 10th century.
 Visitors who climb the steep steps of the fortress walls are rewarded with stunning views of the town, Lake Ohrid and the surrounding mountains.

3. <b>The Ohrid Ancient Theatre</b> - The Ancient Theatre of Ohrid is one of the largest in the Balkans (holding some 20,000) people and was the only Greco theater in Macedonia. It was buried after the fall of the Roman Empire, preserving it for centuries. It was rediscovered and renovated in the 1980s. Every summer, the theater hosts a lively music and cultural festival.

4. <b> The Monastery of St.John Kaneo</b> - If you see one picture of Lake Ohrid, this is it: the absolutely iconic church atop a small cliff on the shores of the lake. The whole scene looks like it is stripped right out of an episode of Game of Thrones. This is the Monastery of St. John of Kaneo.

5. <b> Bay of bones </b> - Ohrid was enriched with another cultural and historical landmark as well as with a tourist attraction - Museum on Water - 
an exceptional archaeological complex, which is one of a kind in the region. On the southern coast of Gradiste Peninsula in the Bay of Bones, a pile-dwelling settlement has been erected, which in the past was spreading at a total surface of 8.500 m2. Bay of the Bones is an authentic reconstruction of a part of the pile-dwelling settlement, dating back between 1200 and 700 BC.

<i>Nationality- the status of belonging to a particular nation.</i> <br>
For me this was never important. As a person who is always trying to be open-minded and respectful, meeting people with different backgrounds has always been a pleasure.


Here are some of the pros of having international friendships that I have experienced:

<b> 1. We teach each other.</b>
It is so cool that you can teach people about your countries and they can teach you about their own. I just love taking my international friends all over my home and feeling like a tourist in my own country. They can also tell you all about their country and what they do their on a regular basis. You definitely get a different take on the world around you.

<b> 2. You have a home all over the world. </b>
With so many friends from different countries I can really go anywhere and have somewhere to stay that feels like home.

<b>3. You learn to be more accepting. </b>
The media portrays many countries in the world as bad and scary, but having friends from these places I now understand that these perceptions are wrong. Many people in these countries are nice and friendly, but we do not know that until we have friends from there and learn about them on firsthand account. I am now more accepting of other faiths, traditions and cultures because of my international friends.

<b> 4. I miss them when they are gone.</b>
Them and their funny stories and laughter!

<b> 5. You will find friends forever. </b>
The love for all my many international friends is hard to put into worlds, but they are some of the best people that I have ever met. Even if we do not share the same religious beliefs, culture or even language, we all share one thing, which is our friendship. Having international friends is one of the best things you can do in college, so try it out and I promise that you will not regret your decision. 

<b>And to all my international friends, I love you guys so much and cannot wait for the next time we meet again!</b>

Oh, how nice it is to have friends from all parts of Macedonia! I think that my friends Sandra and Edvin would totally agree with me.
The two of them are my colleagues, who I met this year at Uni. It is weird how you immediately connect with some people. 

Anyway, a week ago they came to visit me and my other friend Filip, in our hometown Kavadarci. To be honest, I really liked Kavadarci more when walking around with "tourists" and pretending to be their guide. Therefore, in that spirit I decided to share some of its gems here.

First of all, we visited Kosturnica- a monument inscribed with the names of local soldiers killed during WWII, set in the city park and offering views of the city. As you can see on the photo, it is quite outstanding. It actually represents an old Macedonian house. From here, you can see the whole town and the view is breathtaking!

We continued the adventure just by wandering on the streets, because that's the way to really feel a town you know. After a while though the heat reminded us that we should grab a coffee and head for the beautiful nature in Mokliste.

Here is a very “cinematic“ group photo of the four of us. After this, we headed home to get ready for the upcoming party evening, because still, we live in the city of wine you know!

Since I travel a lot, it is logical for me to spend some time 
on waiting for buses, flights, horses and other manners of transportation.

Once, while spending 12 hours on the Turkish airport in Istanbul, I came up with a list of things
you can do when you're in a situation like this.

So here it is:

* Playing tic tac toe when travelling with someone else
* Read a book
* Play games on the phone 
* Observe other people- this proved as a really fun activity to do (at least for me)
* Make drawings to embrace your creativity
* Get something to eat
* Meet some new people- the airport is a weirdly good place to do this
* Think of opening a start-up 
* Ask someone from a different country to teach you words in their language

Well, that is pretty much it. If you have some ideas, please share them with me so that I can add them to the list!

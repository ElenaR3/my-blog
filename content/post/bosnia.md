As I may have mentioned, I am a huge fan of the Erasmus programme. It is just that I have so many amazing experiences 
that it drives me to search for more. Recently, I have been on a training in Banja Luka, Bosnia. It was my first time in Bosnia
and I can easily say I would never forget it. I don't know if it is Bosnian magic or just the rahat lokum, but that's the reality!

As you probably know, Sarajevo is the capital and the biggest city, but
Banja Luka is the second and also a city with history (which I really appreciate when visiting a city).
The first sight that comes to mind at the moment is the Kastel- a fortress that is relatively well-preserved, and is one of Banja Luka's main attractions, situated on the left bank of the Vrbas river in the very center of town.

I won't go too much into these sights, since you have these kind of stuff all over the Internet, BUT I will share with with you the amazing ice cream that costs ONLY 1 marka (30 denars)!

While this ice cream is all colorful and lively, I can't say that 
is the case with Bosnia as a country. I guess it is not that easy 
to live in a post-war country, but the youngsters that I met there really gave me some hope
that everything is possible if you are determined to do it!

Until next time, Bosnia!

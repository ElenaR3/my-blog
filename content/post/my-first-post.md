# Hi there!

Let me tell you something about myself :)

I am a very curious person and in my opinion, everyone should be. That is how we discover, absorb and grow.
I think that learning should be purposeful, enlightening and thought-provoking, which is why I recommend a combination of reading and travel.

On this blog you can read about some of my experiences, but also advices about how to create your own without struggles.
 
 I really hope you will enjoy the content as much as I did while making it. Stay positive and let the good times roll!

<p>Visiting Matka Canyon should be on top on any travelerâ€™s bucket list to the Balkans. It is a truly sensational place. Despite mesmerizing nature, this canyon also offers an extensive list of entertaining activities travelers can try for an unforgettable adventure. Nature lovers (as myself) can climb rocks, rent a kayak or have an exceptional dining experience.</p>

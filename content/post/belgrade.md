A week ago, I was on an Erasmus+ training course in Banja Luka, Bosnia. Luckily, on my way back home I had the chance to visit Belgrade too. I really like when this happens- two birds with one stone.
So, Belgrade is a city that my grandfather has always told me about. I think he was the one that made me so excited about it. Was it worth it? Comme ci, comme Ã§a.

I don't wanna judge too fast, because I had one day only, which is not enough to see everything. Plus, there is too much construction work being done in the moment in the city, which probably contributed to my whole picture. 

Anyway, I will say just what I really liked. So, we first visited Kalemegdan, which is really nice (probably even nicer if the weather isn't that hot), as you can see on the picture.

 Walking the stret Knez Mihailova was also a must, as it is the most famous one. What I really admired was the street art and hearing music all around me when walking on the streets. For me that really means a city with a certain culture.
 
 Furthermore, I was surprised to see that there are some cool and unordinary bars at the old part of the city.

  The whole day passed very quickly. Unfortunately, we didn't manage to visit Ada Ciganlija and Zemun. But, there has to be something to come back for.
  Now, I am just going to leave this amazing sunset here..

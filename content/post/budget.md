1. <b>Stay in hostels.</b> This one is pretty obvious but it cannot be overstated just how much more wallet-friendly budget accommodation options like hostels are compared with hotels, resorts and rental homes. Not only are you getting lower prices (some hostel beds are literally just a couple of dollars per night), but you’re getting the authentic backpacker atmosphere, and memories to last a lifetime.

2. <b>Souvenirs are overrated.</b> Seriously! Instead of bringing back a suitcase full of touristy paraphernalia, why not focus on collecting memories and experiences instead of material things. It makes your travel so much happier, your bags so much lighter, and your wallet so much fatter.

3. <b>Book in advance.</b> Another simple thing to remember, but often prices will go up as time gets closer to your trip. Booking train journeys, hostel beds and of course air travel ahead of time guarantees you won’t get stuck having to spring for a flashier room or a last minute price gouged flight.

4. <b>Rent a bicycle.</b> When you need to travel that bit further, rent a bicycle. Not only does it allow you to get around on the cheap but it also keeps you fit!

5. <b>Bring food with you.</b> Stuff your pockets for the road! Bring food from home, shop at grocery stores instead of restaurants etc. It might not be as glamorous as dining at fancy cafes and eateries, but financially it’s a live-saver.

      <description>A week ago, I was on an Erasmus+ training course in Banja Luka, Bosnia. Luckily, on my way back home I had the chance to visit Belgrade too. I really like when this happens- two birds with one stone. So, Belgrade is a city that my grandfather has always told me about. I think he was the one that made me so excited about it. Was it worth it? Comme ci, comme ça.</description>

      <description>I am not sure how many times have I visited it, but I know that every time is a good idea. Amazing city with amazing views that leave me amazed every time like it is the first. You may get annoyed by the many tourists around you, but still be able to connect with the magic of the city.
Here are my personal 5 favorite things in Ohrid: 
 Monastery of St.</description>

      <description>As I may have mentioned, I am a huge fan of the Erasmus programme. It is just that I have so many amazing experiences that it drives me to search for more. Recently, I have been on a training in Banja Luka, Bosnia. It was my first time in Bosnia and I can easily say I would never forget it. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it is Bosnian magic or just the rahat lokum, but that&amp;rsquo;s the reality!</description>

      <title>Why having international friends is so cool</title>

      <description>Nationality- the status of belonging to a particular nation. For me this was never important. As a person who is always trying to be open-minded and respectful, meeting people with different backgrounds has always been a pleasure.
Here are some of the pros of having international friendships that I have experienced:
 1. We teach each other. It is so cool that you can teach people about your countries and they can teach you about their own.</description>

      <title>Life hacks on how to kill boredom while waiting for a bus/flight </title>

      <description>Since I travel a lot, it is logical for me to spend some time on waiting for buses, flights, horses and other manners of transportation.
Once, while spending 12 hours on the Turkish airport in Istanbul, I came up with a list of things you can do when you&amp;rsquo;re in a situation like this.
So here it is:
 Playing tic tac toe when travelling with someone else Read a book Play games on the phone Observe other people- this proved as a really fun activity to do (at least for me) Make drawings to embrace your creativity Get something to eat Meet some new people- the airport is a weirdly good place to do this Think of opening a start-up Ask someone from a different country to teach you words in their language  Well, that is pretty much it.</description>

      <description>Oh, how nice it is to have friends from all parts of Macedonia! I think that my friends Sandra and Edvin would totally agree with me. The two of them are my colleagues, who I met this year at Uni. It is weird how you immediately connect with some people.
Anyway, a week ago they came to visit me and my other friend Filip, in our hometown Kavadarci. To be honest, I really liked Kavadarci more when walking around with &amp;ldquo;tourists&amp;rdquo; and pretending to be their guide.</description>

      <description>Matka Visiting Matka Canyon should be on top on any traveler’s bucket list to the Balkans. It is a truly sensational place. Despite mesmerizing nature, this canyon also offers an extensive list of entertaining activities travelers can try for an unforgettable adventure. Nature lovers (as myself) can climb rocks, rent a kayak or have an exceptional dining experience.
 List of activities you can do in Matka:
 Hiking on the edge of a cliff The kayak adventure.</description>

      <title>5 useful travel hacks</title>
      <link>https://elenar3.github.io/my-blog/5-useful-travel-hacks/</link>

      <description>Stay in hostels. This one is pretty obvious but it cannot be overstated just how much more wallet-friendly budget accommodation options like hostels are compared with hotels, resorts and rental homes. Not only are you getting lower prices (some hostel beds are literally just a couple of dollars per night), but you’re getting the authentic backpacker atmosphere, and memories to last a lifetime.
 Souvenirs are overrated. Seriously! Instead of bringing back a suitcase full of touristy paraphernalia, why not focus on collecting memories and experiences instead of material things.</description>

      <description>Hi there! Let me tell you something about myself :)
I am a very curious person and in my opinion, everyone should be. That is how we discover, absorb and grow. I think that learning should be purposeful, enlightening and thought-provoking, which is why I recommend a combination of reading and travel.
On this blog you can read about some of my experiences, but also advices about how to create your own without struggles.</description>

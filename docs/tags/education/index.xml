      <description>Hi there! Let me tell you something about myself :)
I am a very curious person and in my opinion, everyone should be. That is how we discover, absorb and grow. I think that learning should be purposeful, enlightening and thought-provoking, which is why I recommend a combination of reading and travel.
On this blog you can read about some of my experiences, but also advices about how to create your own without struggles.</description>

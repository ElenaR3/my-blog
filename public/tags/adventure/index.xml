      <description>Oh, how nice it is to have friends from all parts of Macedonia! I think that my friends Sandra and Edvin would totally agree with me. The two of them are my colleagues, who I met this year at Uni. It is weird how you immediately connect with some people.
Anyway, a week ago they came to visit me and my other friend Filip, in our hometown Kavadarci. To be honest, I really liked Kavadarci more when walking around with &amp;ldquo;tourists&amp;rdquo; and pretending to be their guide.</description>

      <description>Since I travel a lot, it is logical for me to spend some time on waiting for buses, flights, horses and other manners of transportation.
Once, while spending 12 hours on the Turkish airport in Istanbul, I came up with a list of things you can do when you&amp;rsquo;re in a situation like this.
So here it is:
 Playing tic tac toe when travelling with someone else Read a book Play games on the phone Observe other people- this proved as a really fun activity to do (at least for me) Make drawings to embrace your creativity Get something to eat Meet some new people- the airport is a weirdly good place to do this Think of opening a start-up Ask someone from a different country to teach you words in their language  Well, that is pretty much it.</description>

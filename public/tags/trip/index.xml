      <description>A week ago, I was on an Erasmus+ training course in Banja Luka, Bosnia. Luckily, on my way back home I had the chance to visit Belgrade too. I really like when this happens- two birds with one stone. So, Belgrade is a city that my grandfather has always told me about. I think he was the one that made me so excited about it. Was it worth it? Comme ci, comme Ã§a.</description>

      <description>Since I travel a lot, it is logical for me to spend some time on waiting for buses, flights, horses and other manners of transportation.
Once, while spending 12 hours on the Turkish airport in Istanbul, I came up with a list of things you can do when you&amp;rsquo;re in a situation like this.
So here it is:
 Playing tic tac toe when travelling with someone else Read a book Play games on the phone Observe other people- this proved as a really fun activity to do (at least for me) Make drawings to embrace your creativity Get something to eat Meet some new people- the airport is a weirdly good place to do this Think of opening a start-up Ask someone from a different country to teach you words in their language  Well, that is pretty much it.</description>

      <description>Oh, how nice it is to have friends from all parts of Macedonia! I think that my friends Sandra and Edvin would totally agree with me. The two of them are my colleagues, who I met this year at Uni. It is weird how you immediately connect with some people.
Anyway, a week ago they came to visit me and my other friend Filip, in our hometown Kavadarci. To be honest, I really liked Kavadarci more when walking around with &amp;ldquo;tourists&amp;rdquo; and pretending to be their guide.</description>

      <description>Since I travel a lot, it is logical for me to spend some time on waiting for buses, flights, horses and other manners of transportation.
Once, while spending 12 hours on the Turkish airport in Istanbul, I came up with a list of things you can do when you&amp;rsquo;re in a situation like this.
So here it is:
 Playing tic tac toe when travelling with someone else Read a book Play games on the phone Observe other people- this proved as a really fun activity to do (at least for me) Make drawings to embrace your creativity Get something to eat Meet some new people- the airport is a weirdly good place to do this Think of opening a start-up Ask someone from a different country to teach you words in their language  Well, that is pretty much it.</description>

      <description>Stay in hostels. This one is pretty obvious but it cannot be overstated just how much more wallet-friendly budget accommodation options like hostels are compared with hotels, resorts and rental homes. Not only are you getting lower prices (some hostel beds are literally just a couple of dollars per night), but youâ€™re getting the authentic backpacker atmosphere, and memories to last a lifetime.
 Souvenirs are overrated. Seriously! Instead of bringing back a suitcase full of touristy paraphernalia, why not focus on collecting memories and experiences instead of material things.</description>

      <description>Hi there! Let me tell you something about myself :)
I am a very curious person and in my opinion, everyone should be. That is how we discover, absorb and grow. I think that learning should be purposeful, enlightening and thought-provoking, which is why I recommend a combination of reading and travel.
On this blog you can read about some of my experiences, but also advices about how to create your own without struggles.</description>

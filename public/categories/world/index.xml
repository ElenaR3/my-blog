      <description>A week ago, I was on an Erasmus+ training course in Banja Luka, Bosnia. Luckily, on my way back home I had the chance to visit Belgrade too. I really like when this happens- two birds with one stone. So, Belgrade is a city that my grandfather has always told me about. I think he was the one that made me so excited about it. Was it worth it? Comme ci, comme ça.</description>

      <description>As I may have mentioned, I am a huge fan of the Erasmus programme. It is just that I have so many amazing experiences that it drives me to search for more. Recently, I have been on a training in Banja Luka, Bosnia. It was my first time in Bosnia and I can easily say I would never forget it. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it is Bosnian magic or just the rahat lokum, but that&amp;rsquo;s the reality!</description>

      <description>Nationality- the status of belonging to a particular nation. For me this was never important. As a person who is always trying to be open-minded and respectful, meeting people with different backgrounds has always been a pleasure.
Here are some of the pros of having international friendships that I have experienced:
 1. We teach each other. It is so cool that you can teach people about your countries and they can teach you about their own.</description>

      <description>Stay in hostels. This one is pretty obvious but it cannot be overstated just how much more wallet-friendly budget accommodation options like hostels are compared with hotels, resorts and rental homes. Not only are you getting lower prices (some hostel beds are literally just a couple of dollars per night), but you’re getting the authentic backpacker atmosphere, and memories to last a lifetime.
 Souvenirs are overrated. Seriously! Instead of bringing back a suitcase full of touristy paraphernalia, why not focus on collecting memories and experiences instead of material things.</description>
